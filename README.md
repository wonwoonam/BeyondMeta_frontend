# Origin
With the rise of NFTs and the convenience behind the technology, I figured this was the next central issue that I needed to focus on. Thus, I started making this trading platform.

# Process
Using Adobe XD, it took about 1 month to design 36 pages of the UI/UX. And is about 70% done with the whole front end programming.
